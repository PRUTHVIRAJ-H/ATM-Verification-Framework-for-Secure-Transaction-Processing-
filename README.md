✅ Produces simulation waveforms

---

# 🧪 Run Individual Components

### Run Unit Tests

```bash
python -m unittest discover tests -v
```

### Generate Coverage Report

```bash
python -m scripts.generate_coverage
```

### Generate Dashboard

```bash
python -m scripts.generate_dashboard
```

### Run a Native Simulation

```bash
python -m sim.run_native
```

---
